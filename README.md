UI Design Only â€” No Malicious Functionality

This is a demonstration application inspired by the style of ImGui / Midnight UI, created for interface design purposes only.
MidnightRAT does not contain any harmful code or real remote access functionality.
It is intended purely for learning, UI prototyping, and presentation of how a RAT-style interface might look.
